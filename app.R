      constant between races and ethnicities, with white and Hispanic people being
      slightly more obese than the rest of the population. Obesity is negatively
      correlated with education, and the trend has been moving upwards in recent
      years, meaning that those who are least educated are more likely to have
      problems with their weight. Surprisingly, the data showed that obesity
      increases with income. This may be due to greater access to food. And lastly,
      the data shows that obesity increases with age. This makes sense, as most
      people are born at a healthy weight.",
      h3("Takeaway 2"),
      "These takeaways are about the questions used for data collection for our dataset,
      utilizing the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The chart for this 
      can be found on the Data Collection page of the app. The first 
      takeaway is that health issues have a pretty clear correlatoin to nutrition.
      41% of adults eat fruit less than daily, and 22% of adults eat vegetables less
      than daily. That means a lot of adults are experiencing imbalanced diets and not
      getting enough of the 5 food groups. Going off of this, another takeaway is that
      physical activity is not the sole contributor. While 28% of adults don't engage in
      leisure-time physical activity, that is less than the % of adults that qualify as obese
      or overweight. The questions help us understand more specifics about the health issues
      in America since we can see trends on nutrition and physical activity.",
      h3("Takeaway 3"),
      "These takeaways are about the regions with the most obesity throughout the
      2010s, and can be found on the US Map Visual page of the app. The map chart
      shows that obesity has been consistently increasing from the low 30%s to
      around 40% over the course of the decade, with the largest increases seen
      in rural states such as those in the south. In the middle of the decade,
      the largest gaps could be seen between the states with the highest and lowest
      obesity rates, reaching almost 15% increases between states like California
      and Alabama. The only state with missing data is Colorado."
