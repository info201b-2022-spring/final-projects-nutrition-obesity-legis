# Domain Interest: Health

## Why are you interested in this field/domain? 

With the dawning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our local gyms, recreational centers, and other indoor establishments where we engaged in physical activity became more dangerous and higher-risk to our health. While there were many who adapted by migrating activities to places isolated from larger groups, there were also many of us who lost the motivation and routine to get active, or just felt as if there was a lack of facilities to do so.  

Our group wishes to analyze datasets about patterns in nutrition, physical activity, and obesity in the United States, in order to spread awareness of the decline in mental and physical health caused by the pandemic. Knowing that we are not alone affected by this, we can work together to regain the physical activity of our communities and ultimately push for better health across the world.

## What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)? 

These datasets can help us analyze the physical activity and health patterns of US citizens during the pandemic and the use of technology at home. This can help us understand how we can raise awareness to mental and physical health in the world.
